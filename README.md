# Sillage website

Product showcase site for [Sillage](https://github.com/getsillage/sillage) — a self-hosted, single-user space for private records, history review, and AI answers grounded in your own notes.

This repository is separate from the product monorepo. Documentation, releases, engineering governance (`make check`, constitution, CI), and the application itself live in the main project ([sillage](https://github.com/getsillage/sillage)). Keep the public one-line product description and “no multi-user / no official hosting” claims aligned with the monorepo READMEs.

## Features

- Single-page product landing (English / Simplified Chinese)
- Light and dark themes
- SEO: Open Graph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap
- Hash-based Content Security Policy, security headers, and HTML cache controls
- Latest release tag pulled from GitHub for the Docker quick start
- Static build suitable for Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Node.js 20+

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verification

```bash
make check          # install, audit, lint, typecheck, tests, build, docs, Actions pins
make check-web
make check-docs
make check-actions
```

CI runs `make check` on pull requests and `main`. The gate includes component, interaction, accessibility, release-fallback, and post-build security/SEO tests. The GitHub Pages workflow runs the same gate before uploading a deployable artifact. Third-party Actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs.

Optional local env (see `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set VITE_SITE_URL=https://your.domain
```

## Build

```bash
VITE_SITE_URL=https://your.domain npm run build
npm run preview
```

Output is written to `dist/`. The post-build step rewrites `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml`, injects absolute canonical / OG URLs when `VITE_SITE_URL` is set, generates a base-aware `404.html`, and applies a CSP whose hashes match the final inline bootstrap scripts. Production jobs may set `REQUIRE_SITE_URL=1` to reject missing, non-HTTPS, or base-mismatched public URLs.

## Deploy

### GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
3. Optional: repository variable `SITE_URL` (e.g. `https://getsillage.github.io/website` or a custom domain).
4. Push to `main` — workflow **Deploy GitHub Pages** builds and publishes `dist/`.

For a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file under `public/` (or configure it in the Pages UI) and set `SITE_URL` to that domain.

### Cloudflare Pages

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output | `dist` |
| Node version | `22` (or `20`) |
| Env var | `VITE_SITE_URL` = your public origin |

`public/_headers` and `public/_redirects` are included for security headers and SPA fallback.

### Any static host

Upload the contents of `dist/` after `npm run build`.
